## Comfora Mission

We believe that open-source is the future of development and are major believers of open-source initiatives
created such as the [open source initiative](https://opensource.org/) and many more. We also believe
development is funded by,

- **Transparency** and honesty.
- **Community collaboration** and networking.
- Having people have a say in our **governance and management.**

## F**k *Generative* AI

Better known as our **Responsible AI Usage** policy at Comfora, we are committed to not using artificial intelligence for graphical generations (such as AI pictures, videos, nor audio) on any of our **social platforms, community, and websites (docs included).** Art and graphics are the backbone of creativity, and we do not support AI models stealing artists or graphic designers work without payment.

However the intelligence of Argentic and Text-Based AI is unparalleled, so thus, **we use AI for the following:**

- Code generation assistance *(such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc)*
- Documentation writing assistance
