Comfora *(pronounced ˈkəmfɔrə)* is a **Community Powered** organization designed to bring developers open-source projects with extensive community support and transparent governance in mind.
So while other organizations or companies tries to outcast the community, we embrace the community.

## Open Governance in Mind

We're a open-source community of developers coming together and developing cool projects, it's what we love to-do. However, corporations and private equity are sadly
ruining open-source by outright refusing to listen on how **the community is affected.**

We aim to **change that.** Since our inception in June 2025, Comfora has and will be listening to the community, no matter if the community is mad or not.
