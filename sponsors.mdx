description: How Comfora uses and operates Github Sponsors
---

Comfora now has Github Sponsors, a way for our work and open-source contributions to be compensated for our time and knowledge.

> Developing projects such as Scriptor and more, takes hard work, time, and funding.
>
> Funding is a major limiter for small organizations like ours, any amount of support, paid or not, helps us reach our goals of giving back to the open-source community and honoring the Comfora Mission.

Just **5$ a month** helps us tremulously with server and operation costs, services and licensees, and boring stuff such as legal and more. That's why we use GitHub Sponsors to gain funding to continue the Comfora Mission while supporting our team and infrastructure.

## Available Monthly Plans
